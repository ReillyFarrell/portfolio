{% highlight javascript %}
To watch you smoke,
choke, across campus

is to witness
walking cacophony-

the hack-
ack!  ack!

of tobacco smacks of rocks clacking
against other rocks - a stark

strain in your chords.
Bob Dylan

tracks start to 
remind me of you

a few decades older.
You are no more

a boy scout - they kicked you out.
You never could

cut it out - you
kept on

always like 

I threatened to kick
you out of the house in scorn

but that’s dumb: I’ll lock you
in the chimney.
