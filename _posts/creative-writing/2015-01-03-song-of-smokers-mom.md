####after ["Song of Smoke" by Kevin Young](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/250250)
{% highlight javascript %}
To watch you smoke,<br>
choke, across campus

is to witness<br>
walking cacophony-

the hack-<br>
ack!  ack!

of tobacco smacks of rocks clacking<br>
against other rocks - a stark

strain in your chords.<br>
Bob Dylan

tracks start to<br>
remind me of you

a few decades older.<br>
You are no more

a boy scout - they kicked you out.<br>
You never could

cut it out - you<br>
kept on

always like a bad<br>
habit

I threatened to kick<br>
you out of the house in scorn

but that’s dumb: I’ll lock you<br>
in the chimney.
