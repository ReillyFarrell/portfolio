A dachshund stuck inside a hotdog bun
Does not count as a frankfurter, my son,
‘Cause doggies don’t belong in hotdog buns

And frankly, if they did…well, I’d eat none
I don’t think I could even stomach one
Poor dachshund stuck inside a hotdog bun

I just asked you to make a hotdog run
And now you bring me this?  Well, thanks a ton,
But doggies don’t belong in hotdog buns

Now set him down, you’re spoiling all the fun
I mean, just look at him, you’ve really stunned
that dog you stuck inside a hotdog bun

…Although I’ve never seen a wiener run
So quickly in the sun, intended pun,
Still, doggies don’t belong in hotdog buns

And now my sausages are overdone
Go catch the dachshund, ask if he wants one
But do not stick him in a hotdog bun,
Son, doggies don’t belong in hotdog buns
