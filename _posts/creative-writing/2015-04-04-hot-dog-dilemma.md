A dachshund stuck inside a hotdog bun<br>
Does not count as a frankfurter, my son,<br>
‘Cause doggies don’t belong in hotdog buns

And frankly, if they did…well, I’d eat none<br>
I don’t think I could even stomach one<br>
Poor dachshund stuck inside a hotdog bun

I just asked you to make a hotdog run<br>
And now you bring me this?  Well, thanks a ton,<br>
But doggies don’t belong in hotdog buns

Now set him down, you’re spoiling all the fun<br>
I mean, just look at him, you’ve really stunned<br>
that dog you stuck inside a hotdog bun

…Although I’ve never seen a wiener run<br>
So quickly in the sun, intended pun,<br>
Still, doggies don’t belong in hotdog buns

And now my sausages are overdone<br>
Go catch the dachshund, ask if he wants one<br>
But do not stick him in a hotdog bun,<br>
Son, doggies don’t belong in hotdog buns
