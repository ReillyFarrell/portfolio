An electronic suite constructed from short samples of Masashi Hamauzu's piano pieces.  This suite was made in SuperCollider using a granular sampling patch shared with me by [Bruno Ruviaro](http://sccode.org/bruno).

*All samples used were originally composed by Masashi Hamauzu, and were remixed as a show of admiration for his compositions, not for profit.  Please support his official works!*
