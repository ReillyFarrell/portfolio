A sound-design/music makeover for gameplay footage from The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages.  All sounds and music were created from scratch in SuperCollider and arranged into the four "channels" of GameBoy Color sound in Ardour.

Footage originally captured by [Roxas9408](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PTcmMBhcRQ).
