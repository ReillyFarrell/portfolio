A game piece in which eye contact becomes the score.  Sounds are made with paper and triggerd by giggles, blinks, and sideways glances.

####Requirements
- an even number of players, no fewer than 2
- 22x28 poster-board paper* (as many sheets as there are players)

*During my recital, audience members seated in the hall used 9x12 construction paper.

####Instructions
- Select a partner.
- You and your partner begin the piece standing up.
- Delegate a player to begin the piece.  When this player pounds his or her sheet of paper, begin to lightly flap your own sheet.  Do this all throughout the piece, for as long as you are still holding your sheet of paper.
- If your partner **smiles or giggles**, flap with greater intensity until they regain composure.
- When your partner **blinks**, make a tear in your sheet of paper.  As tears collect the paper will begin to fall apart.
- If your partner **breaks eye contact**, pound your sheet of paper.  
- When your partner **runs out of paper**, crumple the remainder of your sheet and let it fall to the ground.  Both you and your partner take a seat.  The piece ends when all pairs have used up their paper.
