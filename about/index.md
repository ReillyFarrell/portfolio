I'm a composer with a passion for videogame audio.  


Who taught me to use such programs as:

|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| [**SuperCollider**](http://supercollider.github.io) | an audio synthesis programming language |
| [**Ardour**](http://ardour.org)                     | a digital audio workstation             |
| [**Audacity**](http://web.audacityteam.org/about/)  | a digital audio editor                  |
| [**MuseScore**](https://musescore.org)              | notation software                       |
| [**Hydrogen**](http://www.hydrogen-music.org/hcms/) | virtual drum machine                    |

####Creative Writing

My second passion is creative writing - particularly screenwriting and sketch comedy writing.  I learned the skills for both as part of a college youtube comedy channel called [BroncoTV](https://www.youtube.com/user/broncotv/featured).

I studied both music composition and creative writing at Santa Clara University and capybaras at [capybaraworld.wordpress.com](https://capybaraworld.wordpress.com/about/).
