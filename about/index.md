I'm Reilly Farrell, a Bay Area composer and a videogame audio enthusiast.  I compose original work both, acoustically and electronically.  My specialty is algorithmic composition, created in a programming language and environment called SuperCollider - though I have experience in a range of other programs too.  Come listen to my musical works on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/capybarrage-reilly).

My second passion is creative writing - particularly screenwriting and sketch comedy writing.  I learned the skills for both as part of a college youtube comedy channel called [BroncoTV](https://www.youtube.com/user/broncotv/featured).

I studied both music composition and creative writing at Santa Clara University and capybaras at [capybaraworld.wordpress.com](https://capybaraworld.wordpress.com/about/).
