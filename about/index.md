####Music Composition

Ever since I was little I've had a passion for videogame audio and filmscore.  Now I compose my own original music, both acoustically and electronically.  I specialize in algorithmic composition, and much of my work is done in a programming language called SuperCollider - though I have experience with a variety of other music software as well:

|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| [**SuperCollider**](http://supercollider.github.io) | an audio synthesis programming language |
| [**Ardour**](http://ardour.org)                     | a digital audio workstation             |
| [**Audacity**](http://web.audacityteam.org/about/)  | a digital audio editor                  |
| [**MuseScore**](https://musescore.org)              | notation software                       |
| [**Hydrogen**](http://www.hydrogen-music.org/hcms/) | a virtual drum machine                  |
| [**SooperLooper**](http://essej.net/sooperlooper/)  | a live looping sampler                  |

####Creative Writing

My second passion is creative writing - particularly screenwriting and sketch comedy writing.  I learned the skills for both as part of a college youtube comedy channel called [BroncoTV](https://www.youtube.com/user/broncotv/featured).

####Santa Clara University (Class of '15)
From 2011-2015, I studied both music composition and creative writing at Santa Clara University and capybaras at [capybaraworld.wordpress.com](https://capybaraworld.wordpress.com/about/).

While there, I was especially active in Concert Choir, the New Music Ensemble, and the new laptop orchestra, [SCLOrk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lts9vEBCDQ8).
