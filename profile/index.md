####One part composer and one part capybara fanatic - that is me. Nice to meet you!

I’ve been obsessed with Japanese video game soundtracks for as long as I can remember. Composers like Masashi Hamauzu, Kohei Tanaka, Keiichi Okabe and Yoko Kanno inspired me to get into music making. Maybe that’s why, whether I’m creating or listening, I’m drawn towards music that’s both spacious and danceable. Capybaras just inspire me in general.

Thanks for listening, folks. I hope you like what you’re hearing as much as I would like to pet a capybara.

####Creative Writing

My second passion is creative writing - particularly screenwriting and sketch comedy writing.  I learned the skills for both as part of a college youtube comedy channel called [BroncoTV](https://www.youtube.com/user/broncotv/featured).

####Santa Clara University (Class of '15)
From 2011-2015, I studied both music composition and creative writing at Santa Clara University and capybaras at [capybaraworld.wordpress.com](https://capybaraworld.wordpress.com/about/).

While there, I was especially active in Concert Choir, the New Music Ensemble, and the new laptop orchestra: [SCLOrk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lts9vEBCDQ8).
